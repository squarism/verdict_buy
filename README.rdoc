We luv arstechnica.  <3

Sync games that ars says "Verdict: Buy" to local DB.  Compares local DB to your game list on giant bomb.  Anything you don't own that Ars loves, goes on a buy list.  Bam.

== Run
  rails s
  rake jobs:work
or
  script/delayed_job start

== Dev notes
If you change a class in app/jobs, restart rake jobs:work.  Shouldn't need to restart rails.
